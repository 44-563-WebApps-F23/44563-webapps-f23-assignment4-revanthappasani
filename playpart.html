    <h4>A Doll’s House Act 3</h4>

    <h5>MRS LINDE.</h5>
    <p>_[looking at her watch]_.</p>
    <p>Not yet—and the time is nearly up. If only he
        does not—.
    <p>_[Listens again.]_</p> Ah, there he is. <p>_[Goes into the hall and
        opens the outer door carefully. Light footsteps are heard on the
        stairs. She whispers.]_ </p>Come in. There is no one here.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h5>KROGSTAD.</h5>
    <P>_[in the doorway]_.</P>
    <P> I found a note from you at home. What does this
        mean?</P>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h5> MRS LINDE.</h5>
    <p>It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h5> KROGSTAD.</h5>
    <p>Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?</p>

    </p>
    <p>
    <h5>NORA.</h5>
    <p>It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my
        rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers
        are at the dance upstairs.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
    <h5>KROGSTAD.</h5>
    <p>_[coming into the room]_.</p>
    <p>Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?</p>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h5>MRS LINDE.</h5>
    <p>Yes, why not?</p>
    </p>
