    _[looking at her watch]_. Not yet—and the time is nearly up. If only he
    does not—. _[Listens again.]_ Ah, there he is. _[Goes into the hall and
    opens the outer door carefully. Light footsteps are heard on the
    stairs. She whispers.]_ Come in. There is no one here.

    _[in the doorway]_. I found a note from you at home. What does this
    mean?
</p>
<p>
    MRS LINDE.
    It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.
</p>
<p>
    KROGSTAD.
    Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?
    
</p>
<p>
    MRS LINDE.
    It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my
    rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers
    are at the dance upstairs.

    KROGSTAD.
    _[coming into the room]_. Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?
</p>
<p>
    MRS LINDE.
    Yes, why not?
